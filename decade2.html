        <h1>1911 - 1920</h1>
        <p>In 1912, the university came under intense pressure from the people of southern California to create
            a new, rival institution. To answer the calls, but without wanting to concede to creating a new
            university all together, the university’s president, Benjamin Ide Wheeler recruited Ira Woods
            Howerth from the University of Chicago to create a strong Extension presence in the southern parts
            of the state. It turned out that Howerth was even more of an idealist than Stephens and openly
            stated his vision for Extension to serve the people of the state in the ways they wanted and needed
            to be served, irrespective of University ideals. To achieve this objective, he designed a trailblazing
            organizational structure and implemented visionary new departments: Beyond the original class
            instruction, he revived the popular public lectures and added entertainment to them, he created
            departments for debate and public discussion as well as information and social welfare. To reach
            even more people, he pioneered correspondence instruction and allocated an entire department to
            it which served up to 5,500 students in 1917. Extension also began working with other institutions in
            offering classes to specific audiences whose need for education was particularly telling-for instance,
            the inmates at San Quentin and Folsom prisons. In 1915, Extension ventured into new forms of
            education and set up the Department of Visual Instruction to exploit the new motion picture
            technology for educational purposes. Howerth was an idealistic visionary clearly ahead of his time,
            and as such the university implemented regulatory bodies that govern Extension until today,
            including the Academic Senate Committees on Extension (1912) and Courses of Instruction (1913). In
            1917 Extension began offering courses in Los Angeles a full two years before the university finally
            gave in to the calls of the public and in 1917 established its second campus, UCLA. By the time
            Howerth was let go from the university while serving in World War I in 1918, he had managed to
            establish Extension as the fundamental institution and model of the higher and continuing
            education it is today in California and around the world. At the end of the first world war, California
            experienced an economic boom accompanied by a dramatic increase of population, which meant
            that suddenly there was a greater need, and more money available, for education to offer its basic
            academic curriculum, Extension began providing vocational and training courses to thousands of
            veterans and to others eager to compete in new industrial markets.</p>

        <h1>1921 - 1930</h1>
        <p>In the 1920s, Professor Leon Richardson served as Director of Extension and reintroduced the ideals
            of Liberal Arts education into the educational standards and offerings, and recruited standard
            faculty again. His humanistic vision for Extension was that of ‘lifelong learning’, a term for which is
            widely credited, and which made Extension a national model and him a leading figure in Continuing
            Education. In 1923, in collaboration with the American Federation of Labor, Extension launched the
            Workers' Education Bureau of America, which offered courses in economics, public speaking, and
            labor problems and history. Despite the fact that many faculty were reluctant to lecture to ordinary
            adult learners, notably in mission-driven programs targeted at workers, Extension grew rapidly and
            by 1924, ranked second in the country in the number of continuing edu cation courses offered by an
            institution of higher education.
